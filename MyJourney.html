        <h2>My First Dream</h2>
        <p>My first dream is to become a doctor because I want to help people and save lives. I admire how doctors care for their patients and bring hope to those who are suffering. Someday, I hope to wear a white coat and serve others with kindness and compassion.</p>

        <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
        <p>Because of financial challenges, my first dream of becoming a doctor changed. I realized that pursuing medicine required a lot of money, which my family couldn’t afford. Even though it was difficult, I learned to accept reality and find a new dream that still allows me to help others in a different way.</p>

These accomplishments remind me that success is not only about one dream but also about the effort and growth I gained along the way.</p>
